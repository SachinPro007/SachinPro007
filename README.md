### 🔒 Why My Code Isn’t Public

To protect the originality of my work and avoid uncredited reuse, I’ve kept full project code private.

Instead, I offer:
- 🔗 Live demos  
- 📹 Screen-share walkthroughs  
- 🔐 Private access on request (for hiring managers & collaborators)

> I believe in showing *how* I build, not just *what* I’ve built.

### 🧭 About My GitHub Activity

I began actively using GitHub starting **June 19th, 2025**, so my public contributions are just getting started.

However, I’ve been building real-world frontend apps well before that. Now that I’ve joined GitHub officially, you’ll see:
- More projects  
- Consistent commits  
- Shared snippets & walkthroughs

> 🛠 Stay tuned — I’m just getting warmed up.
