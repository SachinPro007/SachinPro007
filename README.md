### 🔒 Why My Project Code Isn't Public

I’ve chosen not to make my project repositories public to **protect original work**.

Since GitHub is open source, there's a risk of others copying and re-uploading code under their name — which could lead to confusion or misrepresentation during hiring evaluations.

📌 To maintain authenticity and avoid plagiarism issues:
- I **do not publish full project code** publicly
- But I’m happy to provide:
  - Live demos
  - Code walkthroughs (via call or screen share)
  - Private previews upon request

> My goal is to show how I build, not just what I’ve built.

### 🧭 GitHub Usage Note

> I've recently started using GitHub publicly (as of 2 weeks ago), and I’m actively pushing new work going forward. While my public commit history is just getting started, my real-world experience and project work are well established.

Feel free to reach out for demos, walkthroughs, or questions!
