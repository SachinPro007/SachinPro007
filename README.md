### 🔒 Why My Code Isn't Public

To **protect original work**, I’ve chosen not to upload full project code publicly.

Open-source visibility on GitHub can lead to uncredited reuse, which might cause confusion or misrepresentation during hiring processes.

Instead, I offer:
- 🔗 **Live project demos**
- 📹 **Screen share walkthroughs**
- 🔐 **Private previews on request**

> I believe in showing *how* I build — not just *what* I’ve built.

### 🧭 A Note About GitHub Activity

I officially joined GitHub on **June 19th, 2025**, so my public commit history is just getting started.

That said, I’ve been working on real-world frontend projects long before that. Now that I’m active on GitHub, I’m consistently pushing code, refining my work, and sharing more projects regularly.

> 🚀 Stay tuned — fresh content is on the way!
